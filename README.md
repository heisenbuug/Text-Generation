# Text-Generation

Text generation is the task of generating text with the goal of appearing indistinguishable to human-written text.

## Poetry Generation Using Bidirectional LSTMs

Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks connect two hidden layers of opposite directions to the same output. With this form of generative deep learning, the output layer can get information from past and future states simultaneously.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Anaconda
* Spyder
* TF 2.0

I have also uploded the data set I used, so you can choose training data as per your preference.
I trained this model on my GTX 1050Ti, as the model is not at all heavy so it won't matter what hardware you are using. This is just a example of text generation and basic NLP
